In the moments when I hear my voice
But don't feel like myself
Wish I could hold you, it's only you

In the moments when I walk these city streets with someone else
I wish I told you, it's only you

Oh, you, only you
When the night is over out of all the places I could choose
I go to you, only you

Feel you just below the surface, darling
All I wanna do is go to you

I go to you
I go to you

There were times when you would reach out for a little more of me
Now I can see how much you hurt when I stood still

But I'm learning what it's like to open up a different sidе
'Cause when something hurts this much I know it's rеal

Oh, you, only you
When the night is over out of all the places I could choose
I go to you, only you

Feel you just below the surface, darling
All I wanna do is go to you

I go to you
Feel you just below the surface and I'm getting on with getting through

'Cause things are good and getting better
Holdin' on until forever
Doesn't seem to feel so far away

Oh, you, only you
Feel you just below the surface, darling, all I wanna do is
Go to you
