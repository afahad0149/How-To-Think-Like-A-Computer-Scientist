0001 In the moments when I hear my voice
0002 But don't feel like myself
0003 Wish I could hold you, it's only you
0004 
0005 In the moments when I walk these city streets with someone else
0006 I wish I told you, it's only you
0007 
0008 Oh, you, only you
0009 When the night is over out of all the places I could choose
0010 I go to you, only you
0011 
0012 Feel you just below the surface, darling
0013 All I wanna do is go to you
0014 
0015 I go to you
0016 I go to you
0017 
0018 There were times when you would reach out for a little more of me
0019 Now I can see how much you hurt when I stood still
0020 
0021 But I'm learning what it's like to open up a different sidе
0022 'Cause when something hurts this much I know it's rеal
0023 
0024 Oh, you, only you
0025 When the night is over out of all the places I could choose
0026 I go to you, only you
0027 
0028 Feel you just below the surface, darling
0029 All I wanna do is go to you
0030 
0031 I go to you
0032 Feel you just below the surface and I'm getting on with getting through
0033 
0034 'Cause things are good and getting better
0035 Holdin' on until forever
0036 Doesn't seem to feel so far away
0037 
0038 Oh, you, only you
0039 Feel you just below the surface, darling, all I wanna do is
0040 Go to you
