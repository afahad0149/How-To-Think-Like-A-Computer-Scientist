Go to you
Feel you just below the surface, darling, all I wanna do is
Oh, you, only you
Doesn't seem to feel so far away
Holdin' on until forever
'Cause things are good and getting better
Feel you just below the surface and I'm getting on with getting through
I go to you
All I wanna do is go to you
Feel you just below the surface, darling
I go to you, only you
When the night is over out of all the places I could choose
Oh, you, only you
'Cause when something hurts this much I know it's rеal
But I'm learning what it's like to open up a different sidе
Now I can see how much you hurt when I stood still
There were times when you would reach out for a little more of me
I go to you
I go to you
All I wanna do is go to you
Feel you just below the surface, darling
I go to you, only you
When the night is over out of all the places I could choose
Oh, you, only you
I wish I told you, it's only you
In the moments when I walk these city streets with someone else
Wish I could hold you, it's only you
But don't feel like myself
In the moments when I hear my voice
